# 🎛️ Dotfiles Configuration

This is my Dotfiles configuration. Here, you can find inspiration, just as I found inspiration from others when creating my own.

## 🎯 Features

- **Neovim Setup**: Personalized `LazyVim` and `.config/nvim/init.lua` with plugins for enhanced coding.
- **Git Configuration**: Handy git aliases and custom configurations for streamlined version control.
- **Zsh Setup**: Custom `.zshrc` with plugins and themes for an improved shell environment.
- **Tmux Configuration**: Personalized `.tmux.conf` for a better terminal multiplexer experience.
- **System Utilities**: Custom scripts and tools to automate and optimize your workflow.
